# Important Notes for Users

1. Before running the RPA program, the excel file should be edited. 
   * For non-CPPM lines,column N's value should either be *"Material"* or *"Contract"*, indicating if this PO's subledger is "Material" or "Contract"; for CPPM lines, Column N should be the CPPM type. Otherwise, the corresponding row won't be processed.
   * For CPPM lines, column M should indicate whether it's a "construction" contract or a "consultant" contract. It's not case-sensitive, but spelling must be right.

2. Always check the downloads.xlsx after the program finishes. The program should log the PO code in AiM. Column Q, R and S are **auto generated** by this RPA program. Please manually check those error messages. Notice the new columns end with *"(demo)"* or *"(prod)"*
   * For CPPM lines, column Q will store the contract id saved in AiM system.

# Install the program (for developers only)

1. Install [Miniconda (Python)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)  on your local machine. You can access conda via the console, to make sure it's properly installed please run `conda -V` to display the version, and run `python -V` to display the version..

2. Create new virtual environment. Open Anaconda Prompt and run (taken an example of python 3.10):

   ```conda create --name selenium_env python==3.10 â€“y```

3. Once it's created you can activate it by running: 

   ```conda activate selenium_env```

4. Go to the current directory, run the code under the activated virtual environment

   ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 

5. Setup environment variables for Windows 10 System. Typical path is :C:\Users\user_ID\AppData\Local\Continuum\miniconda3\envs\selenium_env

6. To show hidden files in Windows 10:

7. Run the run_demo.bat, it will call PO_in_AiM(demo).py, and check if everything works.
8. The current design is to download the latest ***Chrome Webdriver*** automatically when running the program, no need to manually download the webdriver.
